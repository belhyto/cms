; Quality Control System Simulation
; Multiple quality control workers (servers) and one queue
; Time unit: 1 minute

; Customer (Product for inspection)
        GENERATE    20             ; Products arrive every 20 minutes (mean)
        QUEUE       QCQueue        ; Enter the quality control queue

; The number of workers (servers) handling quality control is 3
; The system will seize any available worker from the pool
        SEIZE       Worker1        ; Capture the first worker (server)
        SEIZE       Worker2        ; Capture the second worker (server)
        SEIZE       Worker3        ; Capture the third worker (server)

        DEPART      QCQueue        ; Leave the queue after being inspected
        ADVANCE     12             ; Quality check time of 12 minutes (mean)
        RELEASE     Worker1        ; Free the first worker (server)
        RELEASE     Worker2        ; Free the second worker (server)
        RELEASE     Worker3        ; Free the third worker (server)
        TERMINATE                   ; Product leaves after inspection

; Restocking Process (Restock products to inspect)
        GENERATE    300            ; Restocking arrives every 300 minutes (5 hours)
        SEIZE       Inventory      ; Seize inventory space
        ADVANCE     0              ; Restocking time is immediate (no delay)
        RELEASE     Inventory      ; Release restocked inventory
        TERMINATE                   ; End restocking transaction

; Timer (Stop simulation after 480 minutes)
        GENERATE    480            ; Timer arrives after 480 minutes (8 hours)
        TERMINATE   1              ; End the simulation after 480 minutes

; Control (Start the simulation)
        START       1              ; Start the simulation run
        END
